2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar, plus 2 tbsp for topping
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into bits and chilled
1 large egg
1/2 cup heavy (whipping) cream, plus 2 tbsp for the glaze
1 teaspoon pure almond extract
3/4 cup fresh raspberries

1. position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees f. 
lightly butter a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.

1a. grate the lemon zest, until you have 2 tablespoons worth.

2. Place 2 cups of flour, 1/3 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, 2 teaspoons lemon zest and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl and and whisk to combine well.
Add the chilled butter.
Using a pastry blender, 2 knives or your fingers, blend the butter into the mixture until it is crumbly and well combined.

3. Place the egg, 1/2 cup cream, and 1 teaspoon almond extract in a small bowl and whisk to combine well.  
Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir with a rubber spatula until just barely combined.
Gently fold in the 3/4 cup raspberries.
Do not overmix the dough or the scones will be tough.

4. Turn out the dough, along with any loose dry bits, onto a lightly floured work surface and pat into a disk about 1 1/2 inches thick.
Cut the dough with a knife into 6 pie-shaped wedges and place them on the prepared baking sheet.

5. Brush the scones with the remaining 2 tablespoons of cream and sprinkle them with the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar.

6. Bake the scones until they are golden brown and firm to the touch, 15 to 20 minutes.

7. Place the baking sheet on a sire rack and let the scones cool for about 10 minutes.  Serve the scones warm or at room temperature.
